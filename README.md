# statesAndCapitals


- This lab took me about 2 hours.
- Gson and Json are not working properly and tests are not passing.
- Code is complete for the most part.
- Imported classes in all of the classes. Had difficulty with setup. I copied down class repo and pasted the statesAndCapitals folder into this project.
- Also double checked all of the files to make sure they were correct.
